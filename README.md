How do I approach designing software? 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?  What design process did you follow for your project work?  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
- New design skills that helped me craft includes the implemetation off headers into my code.  Specificlly we also designed in a way that the code would be grouped together based off their fucntionality.  Since the code is all grouped together, it allows for others to read the code especailly through comments left behind to implement into their code for future projects.  


How do I approach developing programs?  
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?  How did iteration factor into your development?  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
-The first development strategy was to keep the code in the same format throughtout after creating my first 3D object.  Iteration was a factor when looking to debug the code if any errors occured.  This helped by comparing it to the previous that rendered correctly.  The code developed when new headers are introduced to amnipulate the scene.  



How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
-The skills that will in the future is commenting code, grouping code together, and being able to implement other source files within the code.  These skills will help future projects that may have this extensive of a code.  Computational graphics will help me by understanding the concept and how it is implemented into projects even if im not actaully working on that part of that project.
